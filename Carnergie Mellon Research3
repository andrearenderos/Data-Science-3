Why do we need a grammar in data science?
who are the end users of our(research) code? myself, stakeholders, community, etc. you in the present and future. 
Writting code emphatically to ourselves. 
writting code is hard but we practice we can get there. 
In research code should be easy to understand. 
We need code thats easy to understand with easy grammar. Tidy grammar for data wrangling.
Objects = tibble data frama
Functions = verbs
code = composition
The %>% Allows to write function composition in a left-to right manner.
some Y value and some X value.
Graphics reveal data - Edward Tufte
The grammar of graphics- principal data visualization framework introduced by Leland Wilkinson
Start with raw data --> Visualize transformations, summaries, etc.
Data, geom, aes, scale, facet, stat, coordinate systems.
ggplot creates the canvas 
Scale_X_continuous 
It could be that we add a lay out or statistical to the data set. 
We enherit the desing and we do not have to stick to the theme. 
You can add dementions of color. 
one scale for each mapped variable on the graph
We must label our plots > costum theme as well it usually comes in grey
instead of copying code, we just need to pevit the dat. 
We pevit the colums. We split the variables.
